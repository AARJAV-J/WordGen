# WordGen
WordGen is my first ever github project and is basically a wordlist generator for brute-force password cracking and other uses for password creation. It is designed in java 100% and I have tried to make it one of the most simple wordlist generator so far.

This is fully made in java and not in any scripting languages like Python or Bash. That's the reason, it has such a diffrent way of installing.
PLEASE REPORT BUGS TO ME IN ISSUES SECTION OF GITHUB REPOSITORY AND ALSO SUGGEST ME CHANGES YOU WANT.LET'S MAKE WORDGEN THE BEST WORDLIST CREATOR OUT IN MARKET!!!
